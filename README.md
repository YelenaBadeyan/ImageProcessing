# Image Processing Plugin Framework (ASP.NET Core)

This is a simulation of an image processing backend API built in ASP.NET Core. It uses a plugin-based architecture to apply configurable effects (e.g., Resize, Blur, Grayscale) to images in a clean, extensible, and object-oriented manner.

> ⚠️ This project is a backend simulation only. No actual image manipulation is performed.
